# argparseDecorator Examples

This folder has a few examples to show how the argparseDecorator can be used to implement command line interfaces.

1. simple_cli.py is a very simple cli that takes input from stdin. It has a few sample commands that show a few basic
   features of the argparseDecorator.

2. ssh_cli.py is a more involved demo that shows how argparseDecorator can be used to create a CLI that can be accessed
   remotly via ssh.

    - This demo requires the [asyncssh](https://pypi.org/project/asyncssh/) and the
      [prompt toolkit](https://pypi.org/project/prompt-toolkit/) libraries.
